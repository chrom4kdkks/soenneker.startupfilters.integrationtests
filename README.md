# 🚀 Soenneker Startup Filters Integration Tests

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue.svg) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg) ![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)

Welcome to the **Soenneker Startup Filters Integration Tests** repository! This project provides essential middleware for integration testing in C# applications using the .NET framework. The middleware allows developers to easily manage and test various components of their applications during startup, ensuring a robust testing environment.

## 📦 Overview

The main purpose of this repository is to facilitate integration testing by providing a specialized startup filter that can be injected into the middleware pipeline. This enables developers to set up fixtures and execute integration tests smoothly.

## 🛠 Features

- Easy integration with existing .NET applications.
- Simplified management of middleware for testing.
- Configurable startup filters to meet diverse testing needs.
- Support for various testing scenarios, including unit tests and functional tests.

## 🔧 Usage

Integrating the startup filter is straightforward. Add the filter to your middleware configuration during application startup. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Modify `Startup.cs`**

   Open your `Startup.cs` file and add the filter:

   ```csharp
   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
   {
       services.AddStartupFilter<MyCustomStartupFilter>();
   }
   ```

2. **Create Your Custom Filter**

   Create a class that implements the `IStartupFilter` interface:

   ```csharp
   public class MyCustomStartupFilter : IStartupFilter
   {
       public Action<IApplicationBuilder> Configure(Action<IApplicationBuilder> next)
       {
           return builder =>
           {
               // Custom middleware logic here
               next(builder);
           };
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Run Your Application**

   Once you've configured the startup filter, run your application:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## 🔍 Examples

Here are some example scenarios using the startup filter:

### Example 1: Simple Middleware

Create a simple middleware to log requests:

```csharp
public class RequestLoggingMiddleware
{
   private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

   public RequestLoggingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
   {
       _next = next;
   }

   public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
   {
       Console.WriteLine($"Incoming request: {context.Request.Path}");
       await _next(context);
   }
}
```

Then, use the middleware in your startup filter:

```csharp
public class LoggingStartupFilter : IStartupFilter
{
   public Action<IApplicationBuilder> Configure(Action<IApplicationBuilder> next)
   {
       return builder =>
       {
           builder.UseMiddleware<RequestLoggingMiddleware>();
           next(builder);
       };
   }
}
```

### Example 2: Configuration-based Middleware

Suppose you want to conditionally enable middleware based on configuration settings:

```csharp
public class ConfigurableMiddleware
{
   private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
   private readonly bool _isEnabled;

   public ConfigurableMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, bool isEnabled)
   {
       _next = next;
       _isEnabled = isEnabled;
   }

   public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
   {
       if (_isEnabled)
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Configurable middleware is active.");
       }
       await _next(context);
   }
}
```

Use it in your startup filter like this:

```csharp
public class ConfigurableStartupFilter : IStartupFilter
{
   private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

   public ConfigurableStartupFilter(IConfiguration configuration)
   {
       _configuration = configuration;
   }

   public Action<IApplicationBuilder> Configure(Action<IApplicationBuilder> next)
   {
       var isEnabled = _configuration.GetValue<bool>("Middleware:ConfigurableMiddleware");
       
       return builder =>
       {
           builder.UseMiddleware<ConfigurableMiddleware>(isEnabled);
           next(builder);
       };
   }
}
```
